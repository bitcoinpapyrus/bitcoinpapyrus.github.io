I am a graduate student who created this website as a fun side project to unify the whole world with 
stories and blockchain technology. I want to show how blockchain is more than just a currency. It is a shared written record. 
I decided to use <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/"> bitcoin</a>   because it is the most popular cryptocurrency.
If you do not have any, you can get some at  <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/"> coinbase</a>.

Ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_tablet"> Romans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execration_texts"> Egyptians</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Magical_Papyri"> Greeks</a>
tried to preserve writings on various materials. These include the famous Roman lead curse tablets that archeologists can uncover today.
I think we should all write things we want into the blockchain, which ensures digital preservation and accessibility of our writings. Let the experiment begin.
